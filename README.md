face detection - yup

face recognition - sorta. Currently only trained to recognize Beyonce.

face greening - incomplete. Lazy implementation only paints entire square green. Needs something to do background subtraction to isolate face.

eye detection and morse code from blinks - eyes are detected and found but morse code inconsistent

test code - NOPE. need more time to write all the test code. Another case of TDD avoidance.

C++ inclusion - NOPE. all time burned on feature implementation.
